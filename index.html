      <h3>Mannequinn</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-7">
          <br>
          <p>Mannequinn is a responsive web application built using Ruby on Rails. It is a fashion rental service that offer's
            members the chance to rent or loan items from/ to one and other. It was designed, built and shipped to development by a
            team of three in just 2 weeks.</p>
            <p>I have grown increasingly conscious of the effect that fast fashion has on the planet and on a social level too. We have
              a responsibility to the planet and people to cut down and start reusing what we already have. I found that the market
              was lacking a user to user app where people could rent clothes from each other and rent out their wardrobes too. Why not
              save the planet and make save yourself some cash at the same time? It's a win-win situation in my eyes. This is where
              the Mannequinn prototype comes in.</p>
